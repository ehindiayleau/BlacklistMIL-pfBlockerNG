# BlacklistMIL-pfBlockerNG
IP Blocklist for pfBlockerNG on pfsense and similar, blocking US Military and Government IP Addresses.

Use the following in pfBlockerNG:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehindiayleau/BlacklistMIL-pfBlockerNG/master/blacklistmil_pfblockerng.txt

Due to changing IP addresses, many of these will need to be checked again.

The optional blacklistmil_rootservers.txt includes the root servers run by the military.


This is a single file version of the Windows Firewall batch script version I created, which is probablamtic, yet was the only way to include so many IP addresses in Windows Firewall. Further information can be found on that page at: https://github.com/ehindiayleau/BlacklistMIL Those files and info however have not been updated for some time.

Feel free to use and modify as needed, as addresses will need to be rechecked periodically.
