# BlacklistMIL-pfBlockerNG
IP Blocklist for pfBlockerNG on pfsense and similar, blocking US Military and Government IP Addresses.

Use the following in pfBlockerNG:

This is a single file version of the Windows Firewall batch script version I created. Further information can be found on that page at: https://github.com/ehindiayleau/BlacklistMIL

Feel free to use and modify as needed, as addresses will need to be rechecked at some point. No potential issues at this time.
